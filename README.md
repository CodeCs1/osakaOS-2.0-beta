# osakaOS v1.0
<h3>THE operating system of all time.</h3>

osakaOS is a 32 bit, singletasking, megalithic operating system that is made with a focus on unconventional/ridicoulous design choices. It uses a text-based command line to edit files using the <b>Osaka FileSystem</b> and create small programs using the <b>AyumuScript</b> scripting language. It also features small programs called 'modes' for small games and entertainment. The commands include the ability to read and write directly to memory, disk sectors, and most importantly, print ASCII art of Osaka :)
